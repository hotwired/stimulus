# Actions

_Actions_ are how you handle DOM events in your controllers.

<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value="click->gallery#next">

```html
<div data-controller="gallery">
  <button data-action="click->gallery#next">…</button>
</div>
```

<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value="next">

```js
// controllers/gallery_controller.js
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  next(event) {
    // …
  }
}
```

An action is a connection between:

* a controller method
* the controller's element
* a DOM event listener

## Descriptors

The `data-action` value `click->gallery#next` is called an _action descriptor_. In this descriptor:

* `click` is the name of the DOM event to listen for
* `gallery` is the controller identifier
* `next` is the name of the method to invoke

### Event Shorthand

Stimulus lets you shorten the action descriptors for some common element/event pairs, such as the button/click pair above, by omitting the event name:

<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value="gallery#next">

```html
<button data-action="gallery#next">…</button>
```

The full set of these shorthand pairs is as follows:

Element           | Default Event
----------------- | -------------
a                 | click
button            | click
form              | submit
input             | input
input type=submit | click
select            | change
textarea          | input

## KeyboardEvent Filter

You may have Actions that you wish to run only when certain keystrokes are received.

You can install an event listener that responds only to the `Escape` key by adding `.esc` to the event name of the action descriptor, as in the following example.

```html
<div data-controller="modal"
     data-action="keydown.esc->modal#close" tabindex="0">
</div>
```

This will only work if the event being fired is a keyboard event.

The correspondence between these filter modifier and keys is shown below.

Modifier | Key Name
-------- | --------
enter    | Enter
tab      | Tab
esc      | Escape
space:   | " "
up       | ArrowUp
down     | ArrowDown
left     | ArrowLeft
right    | ArrowRight
home     | Home
end      | End

### Global Events

Sometimes a controller needs to listen for events dispatched on the global `window` or `document` objects.

You can append `@window` or `@document` to the event name (contains filter modifer) in an action descriptor to install the event listener on `window` or `document`, respectively, as in the following example:

<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value="resize@window">

```html
<div data-controller="gallery"
     data-action="resize@window->gallery#layout">
</div>
```

### Options

You can append one or more _action options_ to an action descriptor if you need to specify [DOM event listener options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#Parameters).

<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value=":!passive">
<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value=":capture">

```html
<div data-controller="gallery"
     data-action="scroll->gallery#layout:!passive">
  <img data-action="click->gallery#open:capture">
```

Stimulus supports the following action options:

Action option | DOM event listener option
------------- | -------------------------
`:capture`    | `{ capture: true }`
`:once`       | `{ once: true }`
`:passive`    | `{ passive: true }`
`:!passive`   | `{ passive: false }`

## Event Objects

An _action method_ is the method in a controller which serves as an action's event listener.

The first argument to an action method is the DOM _event object_. You may want access to the event for a number of reasons, including:

* to read the key code from a keyboard event
* to read the coordinates of a mouse event
* to read data from an input event
* to prevent the browser's default behavior for an event
* to find out which element dispatched an event before it bubbled up to this action

The following basic properties are common to all events:

Event Property      | Value
------------------- | -----
event.type          | The name of the event (e.g. `"click"`)
event.target        | The target that dispatched the event (i.e. the innermost element that was clicked)
event.currentTarget | The target on which the event listener is installed (either the element with the `data-action` attribute, or `document` or `window`)

<br>The following event methods give you more control over how events are handled:

Event Method            | Result
----------------------- | ------
event.preventDefault()  | Cancels the event's default behavior (e.g. following a link or submitting a form)
event.stopPropagation() | Stops the event before it bubbles up to other listeners on parent elements

## Multiple Actions

The `data-action` attribute's value is a space-separated list of action descriptors.

It's common for any given element to have many actions. For example, the following input element calls a `field` controller's `highlight()` method when it gains focus, and a `search` controller's `update()` method every time the element's value changes:

<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value="focus->field#highlight">
<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value="input->search#update">

```html
<input type="text" data-action="focus->field#highlight input->search#update">
```

When an element has more than one action for the same event, Stimulus invokes the actions from left to right in the order that their descriptors appear.

The action chain can be stopped at any point by calling `Event#stopImmediatePropagation()` within an action. Any addtional actions to the right will be ignored:

```javascript
highlight: function(event) {
  event.stopImmediatePropagation()
  // ...
}
```

## Naming Conventions

Always use camelCase to specify action names, since they map directly to methods on your controller.

Avoid action names that simply repeat the event's name, such as `click`, `onClick`, or `handleClick`:

<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value="#click" data-callout-type-value="avoid">

```html
<button data-action="click->profile#click">Don't</button>
```

Instead, name your action methods based on what will happen when they're called:

<meta data-controller="callout" data-callout-text-value="#showDialog" data-callout-type-value="prefer">

```html
<button data-action="click->profile#showDialog">Do</button>
```

This will help you reason about the behavior of a block of HTML without having to look at the controller source.
