### A modest JavaScript framework for the HTML you already have

Stimulus is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. It doesn't seek to take over your entire front-end—in fact, it's not concerned with rendering HTML at all. Instead, it's designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine. Stimulus pairs beautifully with [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) to provide a complete solution for fast, compelling applications with a minimal amount of effort.

How does it work? Sprinkle your HTML with controller, target, and action attributes:

```html
<div data-controller="hello">
  <input data-target="hello.name" autocomplete="given-name">

  <button data-action="click->hello#greet">Greet</button>

  <output data-target="hello.output"></output>
</div>
```

Then write a compatible controller. Stimulus brings it to life automatically:

```js
// hello_controller.js
import { Controller } from "stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = [ "name", "output" ]

  greet() {
    this.outputTarget.value =
      `Hello, ${this.nameTarget.value}!`
  }
}
```

Stimulus continuously watches the page, kicking in as soon as attributes appear or disappear. It works with any update to the DOM, regardless of whether it comes from a full page load, a Turbolinks page change, or an Ajax request. Stimulus manages the whole lifecycle.

You can write your first controller in five minutes by following along in the [Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction).

You can read more about why we created this new framework in [The Origin of Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/origin).

## Installing Stimulus

Stimulus integrates with the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) asset packager to automatically load controller files from a folder in your app.

You can use Stimulus with other asset packaging systems, too. And if you prefer no build step at all, just drop a `<script>` tag on the page and get right down to business.

See the [Installation Guide](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/installing) for detailed instructions.
